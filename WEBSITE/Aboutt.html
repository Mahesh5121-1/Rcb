The RCB logo features a golden lion set against a red background. The lion symbolizes royalty, strength, and passion, while the red adds intensity and energy. The logo is meant to represent the team's aspiration to be the "king" of the Indian Premier League (IPL). The black and white version of the logo is also popular among fans for its minimalist design.
